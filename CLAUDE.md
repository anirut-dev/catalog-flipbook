# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Static flipbook website for the Sangudom Lighting Centre 2021 product catalog (232 pages).
Plain HTML/CSS/JS (no framework, no build step) + [StPageFlip](https://github.com/Nodlik/StPageFlip), deployed on Vercel.
UI language is Thai (`<html lang="th">`), and README/comments are written in Thai.

## Commands

There is no build, no test suite, and no `package.json` at the project root — the site is served as static files.

- Local preview: `npx serve .` or `python -m http.server 8000`, then open the printed URL.
  Opening `index.html` via `file://` will break `fetch`/image loading later, so use a local server.
- Deploy: automatic. Vercel is connected to the GitHub repo - a push to `main` deploys to
  production (https://sangudom-catalog.vercel.app) and any PR gets its own preview URL.
  `npx vercel` still works for a manual deploy but is not the normal path.
- Image optimization (Phase 1) lives in `scripts/` and is a **one-time run**, not part of the site build.
  If a `package.json` is added there for `sharp`, keep it inside `scripts/` so the site root stays dependency-free.

## Architecture

```
index.html      single page; loads css/style.css and js/app.js
css/style.css   all styles
js/app.js       flipbook init (StPageFlip) + lazy loading + controls
lib/            vendored StPageFlip files (committed, no CDN)
pages/          optimized display images (page-001.webp …), committed
pages/zoom/     full-size images for zoom, committed
pages/thumbs/   160px previews for the page picker, committed
scripts/        one-off image optimization script (not shipped to the browser)
```

Key design decisions that span files:

- **Two image sizes per page.** `pages/page-NNN.webp` is the display size (1000px wide, ~96KB avg) used by
  the flipbook; `pages/zoom/page-NNN.webp` is the full size (1785px, ~250KB) loaded only when the user zooms.
  `js/app.js` must swap the `src` on zoom rather than loading the large image up front.
  `pages/thumbs/page-NNN.webp` (160px, ~4KB) feeds the page picker - using display images there
  would pull 22MB for one strip. Totals: 22.3MB display + 58.1MB zoom + 1.0MB thumbs.
- **Lazy loading is mandatory, not an optimization.** 232 pages must never be requested at once.
  `updateLoadedImages()` in `js/app.js` keeps a window of `LOAD_RADIUS` pages either side of the
  current one: it sets `src` inside the window and *removes* `src` outside it, so at most ~9 images
  are in memory no matter how far the user browses.
- **StPageFlip overwrites `width` on its own container.** `size: "stretch"` also derives height from
  the container's width, so the book will happily overflow a short window. `fitBook()` works around
  both: it computes the width from the free window *height* and applies it to the `#book-frame`
  wrapper, never to `#flipbook`. It also measures `window.innerHeight` rather than `.viewer`, because
  before `loadFromHTML()` the 232 raw page divs are still in normal flow and inflate any container
  measurement.
- **Page naming is the contract between `scripts/` and `js/app.js`.** Optimized files are
  `page-001.webp` … (zero-padded to 3 digits), so paths are built by string formatting.
- **Two numbering systems, and the UI speaks the printed one.** The file position is not the number
  printed on the artwork: 6 unnumbered front-matter pages mean `page-150.webp` carries "144". The
  optimizer writes `pages/manifest.json` mapping index -> printed label (taken from the source
  filename, which is the printed number), and `js/app.js` loads it at startup. The page box accepts
  the printed number a customer actually sees. Never hard-code the page count in `app.js` - merging
  or dropping a page changes it, and `manifest.json` is the single source of truth.
- **`manifest.json` must not get the immutable cache header.** `vercel.json` deliberately matches
  `/pages/(.*).webp`, not `/pages/(.*)` - the images never change content, the manifest does.
- **Source images are outside the repo** at `../catalog/แยกแต่ละหน้า/` (332MB of JPG, ~1785x2552).
  Never commit them. `pages-raw/` is gitignored to catch accidental copies.

### Source filename ordering (important)

Source filenames come in three shapes, and every one starts with its page number:
`0.1 ปก-01.jpg` … `0.6 สารบัญ-01.jpg` (6 front-matter pages), `1-01.jpg` … `214-01.jpg` plus `226-01.jpg`
(back cover), and `215. Company Profile1-01.jpg` … `225. Company Profile11-01.jpg` (11 pages).
`scripts/optimize-images.mjs` sorts by that **leading number only** — `224. Company Profile10` must sort
by `224`, not by the trailing `10`, and plain alphabetical sort is wrong everywhere (`10` before `2`).
Rerun `npm run plan` in `scripts/` to re-check the mapping before regenerating `pages/`.

### Gotchas found the hard way

- **A lazy `<img>` with no explicit height collapses its container**, and a collapsed container never
  scrolls into view, so the images never load at all. The thumbnails set `width`/`height` attributes
  *and* a fixed CSS height for exactly this reason - do not change them back to `height: auto`.
- **`document.visibilityState === "hidden"` breaks browser testing.** A minimized or occluded Chrome
  window does not paint and does not run native lazy loading, so screenshots come back blank/stale and
  thumbnails appear broken. Check visibility before believing a screenshot.

## Phases

Work is tracked as phases in `README.md`. Update the checkboxes there when a phase completes.
Phase 0 = project scaffold + git, Phase 1 = image optimization, Phase 2 = StPageFlip page turning,
Phase 3 = lazy load + controls (next/prev, zoom, thumbnails, mobile), Phase 4 = Vercel deploy.

## Working with this user

Git/`gh` commands are given to the user one step at a time to type themselves — do not run them.
Editing code and files directly is fine. See the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for details.
